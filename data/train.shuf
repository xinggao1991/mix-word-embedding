skip	One of the best In-N-Out Burgers I've been to (let's not talk about the one near Embarcadero in San Francisco--meh). You know how burgers look in ads? Well ours looked camera ready and tasted even better than they looked. Extremely happy and helpful staff (almost thought we were in Stepford). Insanely fast drive thru service.
cls	a	1	We came for the &11.99 steak and lobster dinner and the steak was horrible (I know I know it's $11.99 for steak and lobster, can't expect much) but it was really BAD!!! Service was shitty and not worth the wait
cls	a	1	It's a cool looking place but the crowd was very random. From dressy to gym shorts the atmosphere was off for me. Service wasn't great, brought our appetizers with our main meals and we had no room on our table. Had to use the ledge next to the table for the dishes. Our waitress took forever clearing the plates and we were given two bills by two different staff members. Given all that the food was average.
cls	a	1	I consider myself an expert on breakfast. I know this place is all the rave, but I think it stinks. Let me list the reasons. First, the place is tiny. Second, you can never get in. Third, the food is OK, and their soda sucks; they serve RC! Fourth, the place is always hot in the summer. Fifth, when you finally get a seat it is uncomfortable (They serve fat people food, but yet their seating is set up for a 5'1\"" 100 pound girl). Sixth, it is a small neighborhood place so you would think people would be nice, but they are pretty stand offish. If you have ever been to nasty truck stop (versus a good one), this is the same type of food and atmosphere. Unless you are a yuppie and looking to slum it and want to say you experienced it, I suggest skipping this place.
skip	Not many people will be bothered about travelling all the way to Ocean Terminal to use the Vue cinema. But this is exactly why it's so good. Usually you can watch the latest release with a minimal crowd and minimal unwanted noise.  Vue has an abundance of screens and all with plenty of seating and a wide airy interior. The service is what we've all come to expect from such cinema chains: its quick and easy. As a result, Vue is worth noting if your not one for busy congested cinemas.
cls	a	5	This is place is so relaxing and cute! This is a great spot for college students to study through the late hours of the night or just hangout. Did I mention that the food is delicious? We ordered the honey toast and my mouth almost died and went to heaven. Enough said.
skip	I wish I would have read the reviews before booking my stay.   Renovations is an understatement. Wall paper coming off the walks, stains on carpeting walking to your room, it is worse than hotels on Fremont street.   When we got to the room, there was holes in the wall, wall paper peeling off, pink stains in bath tub broken glass in bath tub, it looked like a bad crime scene clean up.  The only reason I have three stars it's vascular u called the front desk and they moved our room, it was nicer and cleaner, but the condition of the hotel is yet to be desired, maybe after the renovations?
cls	a	3	I used to work on that side of town, and would eat there fairly regularly. It's like any buffet, if you get there when they're busy, there's usually a pretty good selection of fresh pasta and pizza. Go when it's not lunch or dinner, and you'll find less selection, and not as fresh, but overall, a pretty good choice for the money. I would recommend at least checking it out if you're on that side of town and craving italian/pizza buffet.
skip	THIS \""SPORTS BAR\"" HAS NO KITCHEN!!!  That's right...a \""sports bar\"" without hot food.  Simply unbelievable.  Needless to say, my husband and I promptly left and went to Chili's to watch the Heat-Celtics game while we waited through a long flight delay.
skip	I think I did something bad in my previous life that I went to this place. This place is a SCAM. they will LIE AND RIP YOU OFF. never go to this place. They use scare tactics to rip off the money for the work that is not needed.  Please find a real dentist.
skip	I must have blinked, and missed something, as I am not sure what happened to this restaurant. I remember coming here with friends in the 90s and it had big portions, reasonable prices and friendly service.   When you walk into this restaurant, it is amazing. The decor screams, we went through a restaurant makeover, look at us! look at us! And as a person who doesn't like change, I was leary but remembered that they had some good food here. It was busy but we were still seated quickly.   Looking over the menu, I noticed that it had definitely changed. Or did it? It still served pizza and subs, but MORE. The prices have definitely gone up, A LOT. I remember that my usual order of their combo contained had BOTH pizza and a sub, which were no longer on the menu together.   BTW, $3 for a soft drink and no refill.   The food is exactly like your neighbourhood pizza joint, very tasty.  The prices are more than I would have liked to spend.  The ambiance, WOW!!!!  So, food was still good, value no longer there.
skip	It's Target. Definitely nicer than Wally World but pretty much your standard Target.
cls	a	4	This is one of my favorite places to buy gifts!  Who doesn't love fabulous chocolate?  The chocolates here are amazing, interesting (unexpected) tastes- if that makes sense.  One time I had a chilli orange dark chocolate with puffed rice, it was the most amazing piece of chocolate I have ever tasted.  I bought a little box of them and have not seen it since last July.  Godiva is nice but Max Brenner is definitely on a different level.      Their food is good here and the atmosphere is nice considering it's in the mall.  I've had all wonderful experiences here the numerous times I've come for lunch while shopping, and to buy gifts except one time.  About two weeks ago I was here and trying to find someone to help me with chocolate selection.  The two women who were working there, told me with a hand gesture to wait \""one second,\"" and continued their conversation behind the counter.  I stood there politely and listened to their unimportant conversation.. 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and then I saw that I was there standing for 10 minutes just watching them talk while they ignored me and I walked out totally pissed off.  I've been thinking about phoning in to complain about the women, but it's more my style to YELP the complaint in the hopes that someone in management will hear.    On a more positive note, this is the only bad experience I've had here, there are so many times where I've had lunch here and the service (which is always secondary in importance to me next to the food) is perfect.   Try their espresso/chocolate drinks they are phenomenal.
skip	This restaurant has one of the best Caesar Salads i have had in a very long time! Frisee salad was also delish. My girl's pizza was very good. The service was great - our waiter was wonderful. The prices were right.  Overall a very nice dining experience.
cls	a	4	I love this place!  its really fun to watch the cooks make the food right in front of you  for appetizer i had California Rolls (which i recommend)  Saki (its OK but i personally don't care for rare-ish meat  for entree i had Spicy Hibachi Chicken with cucumbers, Chicken Fried rice ( THE BEST RICE) some onions and mushrooms  it was Very tasty and superb service!
skip	We got the signature pizza which consists of fresh spinach, tomatoes, and garlic and it was fantastic.  the sauce was flavorful, the pizza was seasoned perfectly and i have to say that i was impressed! the only thing i may do differently for next time is to ask for the pizza well done.... i usually do this to all pizzas just forgot this time.   We also had it delivered, during the NBA playoffs, and it arrived in about 35 minutes, right at half time; so timing was perfect!!  It showed up hot and delicious which says a lot about their delivery service.  Well done, I def recommend to others.
cls	a	5	Doug, the owner, came out and installed a new pet door in our house and did an amazing job.  This was the second door we have had him install for us and we have been very happy with both installs.  We even had an outlet and a cable box that needed to be moved and he moved them to the opposite wall for a minimal charge.  I would definitely recommend Affordable Pet Doors.
cls	a	4	I'm a fan of malls. Obviously. If you want a new outfit to go clubbing in Vegas, you're clearly not going to go to Dior. What you need is a mall with more affordable clothing with a lot of option.  Fashion Show Mall provides exactly that!   I went twice in March and both times, we went to the mall to look for shoes  since our friends needed shoes. They found shoes that didn't cost $700+. The store has a bunch of stores -- Zara, J. Crew, Kenneth Cole, department stores, etc.   If you need your cliche Vegas outfit (aka half-naked and extremely tight), they do have a few stores that offer those outfits.  The food court also has a lot of cheap food available and your usual food court type of foods (i.e. Panda Express, some kind of Greek place, etc.), but it's more pricey than your normal food court price.
skip	Just northwest of 32nd and Camelback, wrapping around the Biltmore Golf Course, is a 2 mile paved residential street known to locals as \""the Biltmore Loop\"" (Biltmore Estate Drive).  It is flat loop with light traffic.  It is perfect for doing intervals if you are training for a long distance running event, or just an evening stroll if that is more your speed.  It's fun to check out the multi-million dollar digs and it is relatively scenic with the golf course and the mountains as a backdrop.  I mean, there is a reason why there is a 20 million dollar house for sale on this loop (I'm not kidding, I saw the sign with my own eyes).  I always feel safe running here.  There is usually at least a few people running or walking the loop.  I suggest parking by Hava Java and running up to Colter to cut over onto the loop.
skip	It's a nice place, don't get me wrong. They have a good selection, with a wide supply of different candles, fragrances, oils, cards, etc. It's not a bad place to buy a little gift for someone.  They do have (what I thought was) a kind of cool thing where you can choose fragrances to mix into a custom lotion/perfume/etc. I had a lotion mixed for my roommate, and even though there were three different scents in there, it barely smelled like anything. So that was pretty disappointing. Can't say anything about the custom perfume or other custom products.  Overall, it was OK, but I wasn't \""wow'd\"" or anything.
skip	heard they are having a tenth anniversary? so they've given about 15 haircuts, now?
skip	Their butternut squash and kale salad is to die for.  I love that they serve their other stuff on beds of lettuce, as we all need more greens in our diet.  The only real drawback is the long lines.
skip	So obviously anyone who has moved to a different state obviously know how hard it can be to find all the right companies to help you with your job. We booked this place through movinghelpers.com (I think it was) and the number they gave us to call would NEVER work. We could not get through to these people for the life of us.  When we finally were able to schedule something, even the receptionist said others were having the same issues reaching them. I get a call about a week later saying they will not service us because they do NOT want a bad review (the online site has us review companies after they provided service). I guess figuring the communication issues they didn't want to risk their good score. But who knows how many others had the same thing happen. The girl was rude and aggressive on the phone when I was trying to explain we could not reach them, and didn't seem to want to hear what I had to say. Anyway, I wouldn't trust these people. I was anxious to leave a yelp review but disappointed they didn't have a Yelp yet. Either way, they still got their bad review.
cls	a	2	I brought my date to this restaurant because of her previous experience with their green curry. We ordered the green curry and the chicken basil with a sticky on the side. Although the green curry and chicken basil was delicious, the sticky was rock solid. As far I can remember, sticky rice were not suppose to be like rocks.  Furthermore, we ordered the mango sticky rice dessert. That too was a big disappointment. It was sad when my date stated that she can make better product that Yupha.  Lastly, the service was sub-par when it gets busy. We tried numerous times flagging a helper for addition rice. I think the service is good when it isn't busy.   Although this restaurant is close to my house, I don't think I will visit this place much...unless I crave some green curry....
skip	Those who know Primo know that I'm the risk-taking, living-on-the-edge gambler type, the sort your mom warned you against, the sort that has no problem letting strange barbers take their razor and scissors to my head with nothing but a Yelp recommendation for safety and comfort.   That's why, when I found myself in dire need of a haircut while on business in Scottsdale-Phoenix, I ended up in the very competent, very talented, and very hilarious hands of the father and son duo that run this follicle trimmery a couple of blocks from the W Hotel where I was staying.   The shop has the clubby feel of a man cave, with plush leather chairs, baseball memorabilia on the walls, and tvs tuned to The Fugitive (love that movie!). The experience was replete with mild racist, ageist and misogynist humor, the sort that sets apart an established shop from the crappy corporate owned chains whose sole intention is to upsell unnecessary products. At Shaving Grace, on the other hand, the only thing being sold aside from an excellent haircut is an old-world, graceful experience, and Primo now has a new go-to barber in Phoenix.   Highly recommended.
cls	a	1	The only reason we went here was because we stayed at TI, and we were EXTREMELY hungover.  This was the closest pho restaurant.  (For those of you who don't know, pho is the BEST remedy to cure a hangover!)  Here are my complaints:  1. There was no line.  We saw open tables EVERYWHERE.  Yet, our hostess still said we had to wait, and then placed a divider up to separate us from the restaurant - totally unwelcoming.  2. I ordered a regular pho with rare steak on the side.  It was ok - nothing special.  My soup was lukewarm though - big no no...    3. It took them FOREVER to bring our food out.  We were extremely tired, hungry, and hungover.  All of that coupled with slow service made us cranky and really impatient.  4. When we were done, we decided to order sorbet.  Once again, it took a really long time, and the sorbet was really bland.    5. They incorrectly charged our credit cards too.  It was just the two of us, and we had our names and card numbers written very clearly with the amounts to be charged.  I don't think our waitress understood English very well, so I tried to get someone else to help us fix this mess.  That second person didn't understand either!  It was very frustrating... I think my friend's card ended up getting charged twice.  In conclusion, don't go here!  It's definitely worth that extra trip down Flamingo Ave for some real pho.
cls	a	3	Ok, I just stayed here and wanted to point out some points that you may find helpful before booking your stay.  1.  Service at this resort is excruciatingly slow.  (Asked for a bell hop and after 25 minutes of no one showing up made the multiple trips down to the car to load all the bags)  2.  Drinks are expensive by the pool.  (Try a pina colada for $12.  They are strong and granted we are in snottsdale but that still seems a bit overboard for a coconut drink)  3.  The rooms are excellent, large and well appointed.  (although you have to pay for most of the fancy appointments)  The bathrooms are large and very nice.  The bed has to be one of the best I've slept in in a long time.  4.  The lazy river is great for relaxing except for the fact that there are kids running and splashing everywhere with what appears to be absolutely no supervision.  Not even a staff will stop and tell them to stop running even though it is just an injury and law suit away.  The only adult only pool is atop the spa and you have to pay $35 per day extra just to get in to it.  5.  The Meritage steakhouse at the golf course is far below average.  Service was slow and with noticeable disdain from the staff there.  The food is average at best.  Potatoes are pasty, green beans were stringy and the meat was just so so on being cooked right.  I would suggest eating off property if you are looking for a good steak dinner.  I'm not trying to bag on this hotel to be mean but when you claim your a high end resort with lots amenities then the service, food and atmosphere must live up to those expectations and unfortunately this hotel/resort does not do it.
cls	a	3	I wanted to love New South.  I *still* want to love New South.  Alas... meh.  Located in the back section of the Arboretum with most of the restaurants (right next to Le Peep, and if you hit the car place, you've gone too far), the parking lot appears to have been designed by Helen Keller - but the Arbo parking has been a wreck for 20+ years.  I was greeted immediately by the friendly hostess and quickly seated.  The chair did not find my fat ass to be a fun way to spend the evening and creaked every time I moved.   It's embarrassing to be sitting by yourself in the middle of a restaurant talking to a wooden chair, pleading with it not to splinter.  Nice, simple interior, I liked the framed pictures on the wall.  There was a wall-length cabinet full of wine.  The table closest to me seemed to have regulars at it, which is typically a good sign, though with my early arrival time of 5:45, there were only a couple of other tables seated.    The menu was a simple 1 legal sized sheet of paper with a handful of choices for cheeses/charcuterie, small plates, salads, sandwiches and entrees.  I had checked out the menu online, so I was pretty sure I knew what I was getting already.    The food: A basket containing two thick slices of warm bread with soft butter was brought to the table.  The bread was good, nothing special or unusual, but warm and tasty.  I am not sure if the butter was a flavored butter, but I didn't like the taste.  I ate the bread plain. Pork belly sliders:  I have never had pork belly sliders, though they are on every non-chain menu in Charlotte.  I was told by a friend that it is sort of like BBQ.  It is most assuredly *nothing* like BBQ.  It seems that I like every part of the pig except for the belly (how can something so close to the bacon be so NOT bacon?!).  It was unpleasant for me, but that is a matter of my taste and not the execution of the dish - they very well could be delicious for what they are, but I have nothing to judge them by and I plan on never intentionally eating pork belly ever again.  Not ever.   Pan fried chicken:  Pan fried chicken is usually a little darker than deep fried, so I was expecting it to be a little more done than something the Colonel dishes up. Two small breasts, pan fried, served on a bed of mashed potatoes and a smidge of gravy with a layer of collard greens.  Chicken was tasty, crust stayed on the chicken for the most part, mashed potatoes were creamy, but nothing magical, gravy was sparse, collard greens were well flavored with only the slightest vinegary hint.  Plated well, but zzzzzzzzz  My server rattled off some desserts for me that all sounded wonderful, included a fried blueberry pie (hello!), but I was ready to call it a night.  My waitress was friendly and efficient and when I made a face at the almost full plate of sliders when she picked it up, I admitted to her that pork belly was not what I thought it was.  When I was through with my meal and she brought the check, without me asking she had taken the sliders off.  I asked that she please not do that, as it was my fault for not knowing what it was, but she said it was taken care of.  Excellent customer service - so I feel even worse about not being wowed.  I am guessing the gentleman circulating checking on everyone was the owner, he was very pleasant and was making sure everyone was happy.   All of the staff was wonderful.    I want to go back and maybe try another dish, I really did enjoy the restaurant itself and the employees were a delight.  I might need to return just to try the fried blueberry pie and then update my review.

skip	More like 2.5 stars.   This place is kind of a clusterfuck.  The evening classes are always PACKED, so you have to go early to sign up outside which is more difficult and confusing than it should be.   Most of the classes are taught by the owner - and I don't think she is a very good yoga instructor.  She is more of an aerobics/fitness instructor - she wants you to feel the burn, push yourself to your limits and plays loud pop music during class.  The instructor who does the Tuesday/Thursday evening classes is much better and yoga-ish, its more relaxing while still getting in a good sweaty session.  I always feel so good when it is over!   Something about this place that really skeeves me out: Towards the end of class, before relaxation, the instructor (and 2 volunteers) come around and give EVERY person a little back and foot massage.  That would feel nice if this were a normal yoga class, but considering how much everyone is sweating, its kinda gross.  I don't know if that is normal for hot yoga classes, but its unsanitary...   Sometimes the owner locks her dog up inside her car while she is in class, which I think is mean.  I hope she doesn't do that in the summer time.
skip	Office management staff is rude and inconsiderate.  Trying to win in a no win situation.  We dropped by when my wife had an infection in her ear and asked if we would be seen it was about 4 in the afternoon.  The office manager said no, however one of the desk clerks found a 430 canceled appointment.  The office manager came up to her to reaffirm that we could not take my wife as a walk up even though we have been patients for 8 years.  Thanks alot to the desk girl that helped us out.  Thumbs down for the office manager.  The PA is great, however the Dr im not so sure about.  Precribed a sulfa based antibiotic which she had a reaction to.  A full body rash.  This is the most common problem with this drug.  So why not start with something smaller and known to be safer.  Additionally my father in law went there for swelling on his leg and he gave him an antibiotic and sent him on his way.  When we asked shouldnt he go to the hospital he said no.  He died the next week from the staph infection in the leg and kidney failure.  Although he did have terminal cancer with proper medical treactment of stronger iv antibiotics he would have most certainly made it  a little longer .
cls	a	4	Their butternut squash and kale salad is to die for.  I love that they serve their other stuff on beds of lettuce, as we all need more greens in our diet.  The only real drawback is the long lines.
cls	a	5	This place has been here for the longest and I can't believe I haven't taken advantage of it being so close to home. Not only that I was looking for healthy food that was close to my place so maybe it'll be one of the place I frequently visit. Here it is \""FISH TACOS\""! If you don't like seafood, or sea fare well it's fine you can order something else off the menu, but as for me I go for the new 3 taco menu sampler. Can't get any better than the Original Fish Taco Beer Battered and so good.
skip	I come here because it's the closest spot to my house. The staff is awful, but the men who work there are much easier to deal with than the women. ANY TIME I have dealt with a female, I've walked out without finishing what I came to do. They are so unhelpful and RUDE!   I walked in to pay a bill and only had $100.00 bill on me. Th lady who greeted me tried to send me to the kiosks and I told her, no I want to talk to a HUMAN. Then she said \""I don't have change, but you can go to chili's and get change\"" at that point she was lucky I didn't slap her. Basically she was tellin me NO ONE paid with cash that day? I call bullshit. Had she been nicer I wouldn't be yelping my horrible experience but she got all snarky the minute I didn't want to use to kiosks. I guess doing a job you get paid to is too hard to manage. I didn't get her name but I will be getting it!  You would think that since Verizon is the most expensive service, they would have better representatives, but they have like the worst customer service which is just not worth renewing my contract for.
skip	Rarely does a dive bar deserves such high honors but I wish I could give more.   First off, as 2 Asian gals, we stuck out like two crazy swollen thumbs. It was a Tuesday night and there were live bands performing. There's a cover charge BUT when the doorman asked if we were here to see the bands and we honestly said it was out first time, he simply smiled and said \""go ahead\"".  We found seats at the bar and was greeted by a bartender with the longest goatee I have ever seen.  Having ventured into Brooklyn, New York plenty of times...I have seen a LOT of goatees.    We made friends friends quickly with the fellow patrons who weren't shy to point out the house rules which were basically along the lines of \""have your order ready, money ready, don't make us kill you\"".  I won't lie; it was a bit intimidating but after a couple of beers, we were good.  It was a lively crowd and was PACKED.  Bathrooms were immaculate and jukebox/pool table/ ping pong table/ live bands were on point.  I can't say it was my type of music but it worked.   Parking was a bit scary bc it was was on steep hills (hence polish hills) BUT wow, the pierogis were FCUKING amazing (yes, I will try to use profanity bc they were that amazing)!    I almost didn't want to write a review bc not only does the bar rules included something along the lines of \""if you needed yelp to come here, you don't belong here\"" but this place is an amazing diamond in the jewelry store- it stands out the brightest amongst all diamonds.  Will def have to come back.   P.s. Shoutout to Tim for being the best bartender in Pittsburgh- I can see why he was voted #1.
skip	Doug, the owner, came out and installed a new pet door in our house and did an amazing job.  This was the second door we have had him install for us and we have been very happy with both installs.  We even had an outlet and a cable box that needed to be moved and he moved them to the opposite wall for a minimal charge.  I would definitely recommend Affordable Pet Doors.
skip	I booked a Go! Luxury Room w/strip view. It was very sexy/mod, the decor was just faaaabulous! I'm a big fan of the hot pink & white patent. We really enjoyed the set up of our room, the fact that there was a fridge (a first, for me in Vegas at least), and I really liked the fact that there was a tub seperate from the shower (a nice soaking tub at that). Luckily a LUSH opened in Vegas not too long ago, so me & the girls popped in to pick up some bath bombs and bubble bars to indulge. We had a fabulous view of the Bellagio fountains, staff was very friendly. This isn't my #1 favorite hotel to stay at while I'm there, but it was nice and I had such a good time there I will probably return eventually! At least once.   :)  I was there while it was snowing, so unfortunately the pool was closed. The wildlife habitat was open though, I felt bad for the poor flamingos... it was freezing! LoL. There was a beautiful white swan I saw as well, really cool!
skip	a buddy of mine couldn't say enough great things about this place, so we met him and his girlfriend here last night for our first try.   it was very quiet and quite empty, but that didn't turn us off. i started with the calderita margarita, a very large and tasty drink with a peppery kick. we had the fish taco appetizer and i thought it was very good. the mango salsa added a nice spicy/sweet flavor.   my entree was a seafood \""soup\"" in a white sauce. honestly though, as i was eating it, it didn't have any mexican flavor...it was more of an italian style dish. plus, several of my clams weren't steamed open, which means somethings wrong. the very least, they should've removed them from the dish. i've read if you eat unopened clams, you can get extremely ill. my wife had the shrimp diablo. yes, they were very hot, but at 24 bucks, i thought she'd get more than 4-5 shrimp.   the chips and salsa were fine. we had to keep asking for more chips and never got the salsa's refilled...big disappointment. they did not pass the water glass test. our server was sweet, but hard to find. what disappointed me the most was what our dining companions had to say. his g-friend had the calderita as well and had to send it back. minutes later, my buddy had to have his calderita sent back. he was disappointed in his normally outstanding pasta dish. they both apologized for suggesting Caldero and said our experience this night wasn't indicative of their previous dining experiences there.   and they advertise as a tequila bar, but we never saw a menu for tequilas...maybe if you sit at the bar. overall, i thought our dishes were overpriced and lacked Mexican inspired flavors. our friends will be back as they had previously good experiences, but we have other places we want to try so i doubt we'll be back.
cls	a	5	Love this place !!! Best specials all week long!!! Great food and a fun place to hangout !!!
cls	a	1	Had heard nothing except rave reviews on this place, so decided to check it out.  BIG MISTAKE!  Over priced for the quality.  Mixed \""Vegtables\"" on menu... not vegtables.  Was a veggie.  And if you have a coal burning oven, why would I get some nasty snap peas!  Grilled peppers, squash, eggplant seems to be a much better idea.  I went in the next day to complain and was spoken to by a bartender who spoke extremely dissrepectful to me and never offered to even get a manager.  This place won't last with a $6 burger at Flemmings that KILLS the quality and experience!  Too bad!

It was unpleasant for me, but that is a matter of my taste and not the execution of the dish - they very well could be delicious for what they are, but I have nothing to judge them by and I plan on never intentionally eating pork belly ever again.  Not ever.   Pan fried chicken:  Pan fried chicken is usually a little darker than deep fried, so I was expecting it to be a little more done than something the Colonel dishes up. Two small breasts, pan fried, served on a bed of mashed potatoes and a smidge of gravy with a layer of collard greens.  Chicken was tasty, crust stayed on the chicken for the most part, mashed potatoes were creamy, but nothing magical, gravy was sparse, collard greens were well flavored with only the slightest vinegary hint.  Plated well, but zzzzzzzzz  My server rattled off some desserts for me that all sounded wonderful, included a fried blueberry pie (hello!), but I was ready to call it a night.  My waitress was friendly and efficient and when I made a face at the almost full plate of sliders when she picked it up, I admitted to her that pork belly was not what I thought it was.  When I was through with my meal and she brought the check, without me asking she had taken the sliders off.  I asked that she please not do that, as it was my fault for not knowing what it was, but she said it was taken care of.  Excellent customer service - so I feel even worse about not being wowed.  I am guessing the gentleman circulating checking on everyone was the owner, he was very pleasant and was making sure everyone was happy.   All of the staff was wonderful.    I want to go back and maybe try another dish, I really did enjoy the restaurant itself and the employees were a delight.  I might need to return just to try the fried blueberry pie and then update my review.
cls	a	3	Not many people will be bothered about travelling all the way to Ocean Terminal to use the Vue cinema. But this is exactly why it's so good. Usually you can watch the latest release with a minimal crowd and minimal unwanted noise.  Vue has an abundance of screens and all with plenty of seating and a wide airy interior. The service is what we've all come to expect from such cinema chains: its quick and easy. As a result, Vue is worth noting if your not one for busy congested cinemas.
cls	a	2	The food is too pricy for the quality. Spare ribs were not the best, soup was very plain  and both entr\u00e9es were loaded with sodium      and were below par.  The staff is friendly and offered good service.  The atmosphere is nice but what good is a pretty cell phone with bad reception and dropped calls? Would never come here again.
cls	a	2	The one good thing this place has going for it is the beds - super comfy, made it hard to get up from a nap and go out!  Oh, and the rock memorabilia was very cool as well. The room could have been cleaner.  Everything was really dusty, including the items on the snack tray.  We arrived just after 8am on Saturday morning of Fourth of July weekend, and we were pleasantly surprised to get a room right away.  However, the staff wasn't particularly friendly.  Not rude, but just not friendly.  We had breakfast at Mr. Lucky's, then hit the pool.  We went to the Rehab pool first, where we would've had to purchase $100 in food and drinks each to use a lounge chair.  So we wandered to the \""family pool\"" where we could occupy lounge chairs without a food/drink minimum.  It was frustrating that they don't allow any outside food or drinks, not even water or gum!  So when we went to the bar to get a beer we would get a cup of ice too, and either let it melt down or fill it at the water fountain near the bathrooms.  Since we weren't staying Sunday night, we weren't given free admission to Rehab on Sunday, which was fine because we didn't really think that would be our scene anyway.   I'll miss their beds next time I'm in Vegas, but I probably won't stay here again.
cls	a	4	We always get their lunch specials which always come with sooo much! Really like  their panang curry. We always come back for it! Lemon & sesame chicken are pretty good as well. Their pad se ew was \""okay\"". It was kind of dry.
cls	a	3	My wife has recently started learning to change her oil and make repairs on her car. I ofter get dragged along to go get parts. They all know her there by now. Everyone is always friendly and ready to answer her questions and give her advice.
cls	a	1	Included it as a stop on a trip to Vegas, March 2013. Sadden that when we arrived, the business was closed.
cls	a	4	Great show to catch in Vegas! Penn and Teller did not disappoint - they were hilarious and their show is very interactive. I especially loved when they told you how the trick is performed, and they still managed to surprised you!  Would definitely recommend their show if you're looking for magic & comedy act.
cls	a	3	One thing I must say is the entrees are absolutely delish but the anti mass transit owner is a bit eccentric to say the least... I've indulged here two different pleasant occasions, you have to have time on your side if you wish to dine here because there is a strict NO TO GO policy that owner adheres strictly... I had a very tart and bitter banana strawberry smoothie... I would go back but I do not believe it'll stay open for the long haul.
skip	Another Thai restaurant experience - lunch specials are the way to go I tell you!  First off, Panna Thai Restaurant looks a bit more upscale than your average Thai joint, which I think reflects in the price as well.  We walked in to a relatively empty restaurant on a weekday.  As the waiter brought us to our table, he immediately asked if we had any coupons (before we even sat down).  We did not, but apparently they do have a lot floating around and are a bit restrictive about how they are used.  I think they are also on restaurant.com too.  Lunch specials are available everyday from 11 am to 4 pm.  They all include a fried wonton, fresh salad, steamed rice, and soup of the day.  (You can substitute fried rice or brown rice for $1 more.)    Started off with miso soup.  Interesting choice.   I went for the Yellow Curry Lunch Special with Tofu \""Thai yellow curry and Thai herbs served with Jasmine rice.\"" ($6.95).   Fried tofu and potatoes were the main components of my dish.  Raw bell peppers decorated the top.  I wished they cooked the veggies with the curry though.  The fried wonton had peas and carrots in it - a bit different than what you normally find inside one of those things.  The biggest problem I had was with the rice.  It was mushy - too much water in the cooker!  It's never a good sign when the rice gets messed up!   The Husband tried out their Garlic Short Ribs Lunch Special \""Deep fried short ribs sauteed with garlic and black pepper sauce served with Jasmine rice.\"" ($6.95)  It was a tasty dish and lots of flavor, but then again it's deep fried and it sounds like it would be tasty.  Overall, we found Panna Thai to be just an okay experience.  There are definitely a few other Thai restaurants in the neighborhood that has a foot up on selection, taste, and price.
cls	a	5	Rarely does a dive bar deserves such high honors but I wish I could give more.   First off, as 2 Asian gals, we stuck out like two crazy swollen thumbs. It was a Tuesday night and there were live bands performing. There's a cover charge BUT when the doorman asked if we were here to see the bands and we honestly said it was out first time, he simply smiled and said \""go ahead\"".  We found seats at the bar and was greeted by a bartender with the longest goatee I have ever seen.  Having ventured into Brooklyn, New York plenty of times...I have seen a LOT of goatees.    We made friends friends quickly with the fellow patrons who weren't shy to point out the house rules which were basically along the lines of \""have your order ready, money ready, don't make us kill you\"".  I won't lie; it was a bit intimidating but after a couple of beers, we were good.  It was a lively crowd and was PACKED.  Bathrooms were immaculate and jukebox/pool table/ ping pong table/ live bands were on point.  I can't say it was my type of music but it worked.   Parking was a bit scary bc it was was on steep hills (hence polish hills) BUT wow, the pierogis were FCUKING amazing (yes, I will try to use profanity bc they were that amazing)!    I almost didn't want to write a review bc not only does the bar rules included something along the lines of \""if you needed yelp to come here, you don't belong here\"" but this place is an amazing diamond in the jewelry store- it stands out the brightest amongst all diamonds.  Will def have to come back.   P.s. Shoutout to Tim for being the best bartender in Pittsburgh- I can see why he was voted #1.
cls	a	3	I thought this was pretty good - a nice selection of different types of food - fresh fruit/vegetables as well as a variety of prepared foods: sausage, cheese, pastries, etc.  You can definitely make a meal from here as well as take fresh items to cook back home.
skip	It's a cool looking place but the crowd was very random. From dressy to gym shorts the atmosphere was off for me. Service wasn't great, brought our appetizers with our main meals and we had no room on our table. Had to use the ledge next to the table for the dishes. Our waitress took forever clearing the plates and we were given two bills by two different staff members. Given all that the food was average.
skip	Pretty good! Had the basic udon. Reasonably priced, tasty food and the resturant is pretty cool. 4 stars because it didn't blow my socks off
skip	Great relaxing 2 night getaway with my wife.  Service was excellent, room was very comfortable....a very peaceful place.  R Bar was a great place to hang out and listen to music and enjoy some drinks.  Breakfast and service at Rita's on the patio was very good (despite a few pesky birds).  Poolside service was excellent...watermelon/mint iced water; watermelon cubes served from time to time...all excellent.  \""Where time stands still\""...I'll be sure to go back. The gardens are beautiful...we live in the valley and it's nice to visit a place like this and really take in desert living in a very relaxing setting.
cls	a	4	First of all, I like the location of this hotel.  And if you're going to park, by all means do Valet and pay the few bucks tip, because self-parking is a mile away.  We got a strip suite and a regular suite, both facing the Fountain.  Nice view, but though the Strip Suite is supposed to be larger, which it was, it just felt smaller due to the floorplan.  It was rather rectangular and narrow, thus feeling more cramped to be in. The random Hollywood movie decorations are sort of tacky; we had a plastic gun and sweater in our room from Star Trek that wasn't very attractive but I had a pleasant stay.  All in all, the location of this hotel is good, though it's right across the street from the current new apt construction.  Puts you in good location from the North and South ends of the strip.  And there's the Miracle Miles mall right next door.
cls	a	5	We got the signature pizza which consists of fresh spinach, tomatoes, and garlic and it was fantastic.  the sauce was flavorful, the pizza was seasoned perfectly and i have to say that i was impressed! the only thing i may do differently for next time is to ask for the pizza well done.... i usually do this to all pizzas just forgot this time.   We also had it delivered, during the NBA playoffs, and it arrived in about 35 minutes, right at half time; so timing was perfect!!  It showed up hot and delicious which says a lot about their delivery service.  Well done, I def recommend to others.
cls	a	1	THIS \""SPORTS BAR\"" HAS NO KITCHEN!!!  That's right...a \""sports bar\"" without hot food.  Simply unbelievable.  Needless to say, my husband and I promptly left and went to Chili's to watch the Heat-Celtics game while we waited through a long flight delay.
cls	a	5	My daughter decribes Hobby Lobby as \""Michael's on crack.\""  She's right.  HL should not be missed when visiting Phoenix. It delights the eyes, ears, thought processes of anyone even marginally creative.   Christmastime, it's even more fun.
skip	We always get their lunch specials which always come with sooo much! Really like  their panang curry. We always come back for it! Lemon & sesame chicken are pretty good as well. Their pad se ew was \""okay\"". It was kind of dry.
skip	The only reason we went here was because we stayed at TI, and we were EXTREMELY hungover.  This was the closest pho restaurant.  (For those of you who don't know, pho is the BEST remedy to cure a hangover!)  Here are my complaints:  1. There was no line.  We saw open tables EVERYWHERE.  Yet, our hostess still said we had to wait, and then placed a divider up to separate us from the restaurant - totally unwelcoming.  2. I ordered a regular pho with rare steak on the side.  It was ok - nothing special.  My soup was lukewarm though - big no no...    3. It took them FOREVER to bring our food out.  We were extremely tired, hungry, and hungover.  All of that coupled with slow service made us cranky and really impatient.  4. When we were done, we decided to order sorbet.  Once again, it took a really long time, and the sorbet was really bland.    5. They incorrectly charged our credit cards too.  It was just the two of us, and we had our names and card numbers written very clearly with the amounts to be charged.  I don't think our waitress understood English very well, so I tried to get someone else to help us fix this mess.  That second person didn't understand either!  It was very frustrating... I think my friend's card ended up getting charged twice.  In conclusion, don't go here!  It's definitely worth that extra trip down Flamingo Ave for some real pho.
cls	a	1	Office management staff is rude and inconsiderate.  Trying to win in a no win situation.  We dropped by when my wife had an infection in her ear and asked if we would be seen it was about 4 in the afternoon.  The office manager said no, however one of the desk clerks found a 430 canceled appointment.  The office manager came up to her to reaffirm that we could not take my wife as a walk up even though we have been patients for 8 years.  Thanks alot to the desk girl that helped us out.  Thumbs down for the office manager.  The PA is great, however the Dr im not so sure about.  Precribed a sulfa based antibiotic which she had a reaction to.  A full body rash.  This is the most common problem with this drug.  So why not start with something smaller and known to be safer.  Additionally my father in law went there for swelling on his leg and he gave him an antibiotic and sent him on his way.  When we asked shouldnt he go to the hospital he said no.  He died the next week from the staph infection in the leg and kidney failure.  Although he did have terminal cancer with proper medical treactment of stronger iv antibiotics he would have most certainly made it  a little longer .
skip	The first time I went here years ago, I did not like it. I would not recommend their pasta dishes. However, the pizza's, salads, and sandwiches are all fantastic. The pozookies are one of the best desserts around! Service is always good, atmosphere is great! The Santa Fe salad and the Italian chopped salad are great choices and huge.
cls	a	1	heard they are having a tenth anniversary? so they've given about 15 haircuts, now?
skip	Had heard nothing except rave reviews on this place, so decided to check it out.  BIG MISTAKE!  Over priced for the quality.  Mixed \""Vegtables\"" on menu... not vegtables.  Was a veggie.  And if you have a coal burning oven, why would I get some nasty snap peas!  Grilled peppers, squash, eggplant seems to be a much better idea.  I went in the next day to complain and was spoken to by a bartender who spoke extremely dissrepectful to me and never offered to even get a manager.  This place won't last with a $6 burger at Flemmings that KILLS the quality and experience!  Too bad!
cls	a	4	I love this gym, I do wish it were closer to a freeway or either more north or more west for me.  I agree with Will M. that it would be great at Norterra and lets face it, there are empty spots there just waiting for a great gym.   I love the attitude at this gym and the metro location as well.  There is always someone onsite caring for the equipment and keeping the place clean and tidy.  I dont remember that care when i was at LA Fitness.  The equipment is color coded to the muscle they work and that is awesome!  I like the staff and the people that go here and have made many friends.   They also have this new finger print system so you don't need a gym card with you to go, you just enter your phone number and scan your finger (very cool).  Sorry if you are a twin and like to cheat though....  Also be sure you check out Costco before you join to see if they still have the special of a 2 year membership for $299.00 (that's about $12/month)  It's a smoking deal and is good for all gym locations across the nation.
cls	a	4	I booked a Go! Luxury Room w/strip view. It was very sexy/mod, the decor was just faaaabulous! I'm a big fan of the hot pink & white patent. We really enjoyed the set up of our room, the fact that there was a fridge (a first, for me in Vegas at least), and I really liked the fact that there was a tub seperate from the shower (a nice soaking tub at that). Luckily a LUSH opened in Vegas not too long ago, so me & the girls popped in to pick up some bath bombs and bubble bars to indulge. We had a fabulous view of the Bellagio fountains, staff was very friendly. This isn't my #1 favorite hotel to stay at while I'm there, but it was nice and I had such a good time there I will probably return eventually! At least once.   :)  I was there while it was snowing, so unfortunately the pool was closed. The wildlife habitat was open though, I felt bad for the poor flamingos... it was freezing! LoL. There was a beautiful white swan I saw as well, really cool!
cls	a	3	Had the rosemary shrimp, grilled veggies, and the rosemary beef brisket. It was good but there are better places to stop in Pittsburgh. Sit outside and make sure you grab some spices if you want them. It's BYOB too.
skip	Really fresh, unique beers. Loved the pumpkin stout. Good food, had the pierogies, very buttery.  Excellent friendly service
cls	a	4	Nice clean restaurant with plenty of parking in a strip mall.  Menu has nice variety of Vietnamese cuisine.  Pho Dac Biet is good. Plenty of noodles and meat to fill you up.  Spring rolls were delicious as well.  Good came out really fast when they not busy.
skip	Some dishes are good, some taste like they came out of a can from the Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center.  The heaven rice rolls might be my favorite in town, and the lobster dish is fantastic (definitely agree with kate - doesn't taste like lobster, but is delicious nonetheless).  Free tea is always a really nice way to start a meal, too.
skip	The food is too pricy for the quality. Spare ribs were not the best, soup was very plain  and both entr\u00e9es were loaded with sodium      and were below par.  The staff is friendly and offered good service.  The atmosphere is nice but what good is a pretty cell phone with bad reception and dropped calls? Would never come here again.
cls	a	3	I stayed here 6/29/2012 to 07/01/2012.  Got a good price to stay here, so we booked the standard luxury room. Arrived pretty late--about 1:00 am Saturday morning--and got a complimentary upgrade to a LeMans suite since they were out of standard luxury rooms. Sweet!!  The suite itself looked great; decor and furniture were of high quality. Full size shower and hot tub in the bathroom. And a bidet!! The weirdest thing though was the old school box TV set. Umm, okay. Otherwise great room.  The clientele at Paris, however, is OLD (no offense). Nice place to stay at with your significant other; not so nice a place if you're out with your buddies or for a bachelor party.
cls	a	5	We always stay in summer in this hotel, totally recommended, my kids love the beach, lazy river and all the different pools available, great for families!!
skip	Great show to catch in Vegas! Penn and Teller did not disappoint - they were hilarious and their show is very interactive. I especially loved when they told you how the trick is performed, and they still managed to surprised you!  Would definitely recommend their show if you're looking for magic & comedy act.
skip	I'm a fan of malls. Obviously. If you want a new outfit to go clubbing in Vegas, you're clearly not going to go to Dior. What you need is a mall with more affordable clothing with a lot of option.  Fashion Show Mall provides exactly that!   I went twice in March and both times, we went to the mall to look for shoes  since our friends needed shoes. They found shoes that didn't cost $700+. The store has a bunch of stores -- Zara, J. Crew, Kenneth Cole, department stores, etc.   If you need your cliche Vegas outfit (aka half-naked and extremely tight), they do have a few stores that offer those outfits.  The food court also has a lot of cheap food available and your usual food court type of foods (i.e. Panda Express, some kind of Greek place, etc.), but it's more pricey than your normal food court price.
cls	a	5	Celebrated my gf's 25th Bday in Vegas. Needed a cake to go along with all my other surprises. Came up on LAS VEGAS CUSTOM CAKES and was amazed with the cakes on their website. Great price with great work and not crazy expensive price with great work. I ordered a Coach purse cake with custom receipt of all the things we did on top of a Coach gift box and (8) Hello Kitty Cheesecake cupcakes.   The true test would be how this cake/cucakes tested ( have had dry Red Velvet and really sweet Red Velvet - couldn't do a taste test since I am from out of town). The design of the cake/cupcakes were amazing and the cake/cupcakes  tasted great as well! Hands down best Red Velvet cake I have ever tasted.  Did not disappoint!! My GF and I did not want to eat it but rather take it home and put it on a mantel since these are masterpieces!   If you are ever in Vegas, check them out. You won't be disappointed.
cls	a	1	I think I did something bad in my previous life that I went to this place. This place is a SCAM. they will LIE AND RIP YOU OFF. never go to this place. They use scare tactics to rip off the money for the work that is not needed.  Please find a real dentist.
cls	a	3	I love golf....I have been playing for a while now but Tiger Woods I definitely am not... and my handicap leaves something to be desired but I love playing the game nonetheless. I was recently invited to play in a small friendly competition and gladly accepted. So I figured that I needed to dust off and take inventory of all my golfing gear because I haven't played in a while and needed to be prepared....soon after, I realized that my putter was missing, my bag was ragged and needed some help,  and I was in desperate need of some new threads to show off on the course with as well. So I came here....  I love Nike products and think they are of great quality but what I didn't realize is that I was going to need to give the blood of my future first born and sign my soul away just get a putter. Man....the prices were ridiculous!! So overpriced.....and to think I actually wanted to buy a new shirt and bag on top of the new putter that would have cost me more than next month's rent....crazy!! But needless to say the store was beautiful. Selection of all things golf is any golfers dream but I'd rather spend my money at Sports Chalet at a cheaper price for my golf supplies any day.

skip	Took my girlfriend here for our anniversary, because of many glowing recommendations from friends. After being seated promptly, we waited about 10 minutes to be acknowledged by a server, and given water and menus. After this, the server was attentive enough.   We started with the cheese tray, which was good and all, but was only 3 little slices of cheese. For $12 I expected a bit more quantity.  She had the NY strip au poivre (her favorite), and I had the flatiron steak. Hers was undercooked, and the brandy/cream sauce tasted more like turkey gravy than anything else. She's had this dish in Paris, and I've made it several times at home, and George's sauce wasn't even close. My flatiron steak was pretty good, but a little undercooked. The frites were nice and crunchy, but way too much salt.   For the price, there are MUCH better restaurants in Charlotte. We won't be back to this one.
cls	a	2	I feel like reviews for large chains like Starbucks can help people differentiate between the good and the bad.  I have noticed that this place in particular is pretty inconsistent with the drinks and service. There have been multiple times where I've received the wrong drink. 99% of the time I am going through the drive through, so by the time I realize the mistake, I am so far gone that I can't go back to correct it.  On the upside, the people here are friendly. I do not recall every encountering a grumpy or rude person here.
skip	This place has been here for the longest and I can't believe I haven't taken advantage of it being so close to home. Not only that I was looking for healthy food that was close to my place so maybe it'll be one of the place I frequently visit. Here it is \""FISH TACOS\""! If you don't like seafood, or sea fare well it's fine you can order something else off the menu, but as for me I go for the new 3 taco menu sampler. Can't get any better than the Original Fish Taco Beer Battered and so good.
cls	a	3	I hate to be like this, but this new place just isn't as good as the old.  Their pizza used to be much better; especially the crust.  I can't put my finger on it but something is just different and not in a good way.  The prices have always been on the high side for pizza but it was always worth it.  Not anymore.  I am almost never in Tempe so when I knew I would be for the day, I wanted to have this pizza.  I didn't even know they moved until I saw it here on Yelp.  I knew the shopping center where the place is now located so I knew just where to go.  However, it ticked me off that it was a pain in the ass to find because there was nothing that said \""Classic Italian Pizza\"" anywhere on their exterior sign OR anywhere in the actual restaurant.  Upon finding then entering the place I almost had to ask if I was in right place.  Anyway, the service was excellent but I don't think I'll be back because the pizza wasn't go-out-of-your-way good enough.
skip	Really surprised by this place. Very nice! Rooms are decorated nicely, beds are comfy, and spacious. Stayed in a Studio and there was plenty of room! Nice bathroom, nice pool. My one complaint would be the thin walls. We could hear our  neighbors talking all night then when we were still talking at 1am, neighbors pounded the wall to tell us to be quiet lol. The night before the 4th of July in Vegas and you're pounding on the wall to shoosh us? Lame!   Food and drinks at the pool are expensive, and quite a few kids splashing around. I guess I prefer adult only in Vegas but what can you do? Food was good. Room Service menu is outrageously priced. The nice thing is, Elara is connected to the Miracle Mile Shops @ Planet Hollywood, quick walk (indoors, thank God, it's summer!) and there are 15 places to eat in the mall, plus several options on the strip, which is priced roughly the same if not less than room service prices.   I would definitely stay here again. Park at the garage at Miracle Mile Shops. Leads right into Elara, otherwise Valet is $15 a night, your choice!  Views aren't too bad either! Not much else to say, been a fun night/day, one night to go!
cls	a	4	One of my favorite spots to visit when I come to Vegas. It's extremely casual and the the concept is all open which is great. You can custom order any pizzas you want but they have some already created that are great. They even have a Nutella pizza! It's pretty well priced and the pieces are all personal to the customer. Def a must try of you find yourself in the MGM!!
skip	I recommend using Jason for any trip or event in Vegas.The customer service he provides, is nothing but perfect. I went out for my buddies birthday celebration and the whole weekend was full of excitement and amazing memories. I will never go to Vegas and not use Jason!! Thank you Jason for the best time ever in vegas!!
cls	a	4	This restaurant has one of the best Caesar Salads i have had in a very long time! Frisee salad was also delish. My girl's pizza was very good. The service was great - our waiter was wonderful. The prices were right.  Overall a very nice dining experience.

Kind of disappionted, condiments fell out of both halves of the footlong my son and i split and the gal behind the conter started giggling when she was corrected on the sandwhich after putting chicken on it. I think it will be a while before i return to this location again.

cls	a	3	3.5 stars for Naka Sushi  Pros 1. Not busy during lunch 2. Sushi chef EXTREMELY quick. 3. Rolls are pretty good. 4. Customer service was good with some singing and grunting from the chef.   Cons 1. Nigiri quality wasn't up to par. Definitely not as fresh as other places and the salmon was very slimey and gooey. Yuck! 2. Not a huge selection of nigiri. 3. I would say 90% off the rolls contained spicy tuna...which I'm unable to eat right now so boo!   Overall it's a decent sushi joint but I won't be making any special trips to this side of town to eat here.
skip	I love this place!  its really fun to watch the cooks make the food right in front of you  for appetizer i had California Rolls (which i recommend)  Saki (its OK but i personally don't care for rare-ish meat  for entree i had Spicy Hibachi Chicken with cucumbers, Chicken Fried rice ( THE BEST RICE) some onions and mushrooms  it was Very tasty and superb service!
skip	This is place is so relaxing and cute! This is a great spot for college students to study through the late hours of the night or just hangout. Did I mention that the food is delicious? We ordered the honey toast and my mouth almost died and went to heaven. Enough said.
cls	a	1	So, my bff brought me Kaze sushi as a treat while I was at work.  She got spicy tuna, dynamite roll and the Helllo? Roll   .  Now Kaze is only a 10 min. Trip to where I work.  So first off we noticed they forgot the wasabi and pickled ginger. Well regardless of the elements they forgot I popped a spicy tuna piece in my mouth and I tAsted fishy salty insults upon the name Spicy tuna. It was horrible and the fish did not taste fresh by anymeans. So I think well who can mess up a dynamite roll? I look and some of the onions are charred black, the sauce is horrendous and when I ate it, it was even worse. It was super greasy, and the scallops were way over cooked and tough. The final roll the Hellol roll we really cannot remember the name however it is a california roll with spicy tuna on top and a sliced jalapeno on top.  The fried pieces on the bottom were so oily and greasy and not crunchy or edible. I was grossed out, it has to be some of the worse sushi known to mankind. Typically I stick to Nigiri but there is no way they make good Nigiri when they cannot make simple rolls.  I would not recommend any True Sushi eaters to eat here. Their 50% off is for a reason. If you like old smelly tuna and greasy rolls than this is the place for you. Otherwise BEWARE!
skip	I believe, the only reason why this place receives business is because people rather not wait for food at the ramen place across the plaza. Not great. The Thai tea is cheap but comes in a small styrofoam cup and filled half with ice. Also, if your group orders the Thai tea, some will have a good amount of milk and some will not. I chose the house seafood special with rice noodles. The soup was not spicy at all and the soup base made me feel sick. Everything is cheap, but that's all the quality food you get.
skip	The Cheesesteak is the best in Vegas.  Outdoor seating only.  Go when the weather is nice.
skip	I love golf....I have been playing for a while now but Tiger Woods I definitely am not... and my handicap leaves something to be desired but I love playing the game nonetheless. I was recently invited to play in a small friendly competition and gladly accepted. So I figured that I needed to dust off and take inventory of all my golfing gear because I haven't played in a while and needed to be prepared....soon after, I realized that my putter was missing, my bag was ragged and needed some help,  and I was in desperate need of some new threads to show off on the course with as well. So I came here....  I love Nike products and think they are of great quality but what I didn't realize is that I was going to need to give the blood of my future first born and sign my soul away just get a putter. Man....the prices were ridiculous!! So overpriced.....and to think I actually wanted to buy a new shirt and bag on top of the new putter that would have cost me more than next month's rent....crazy!! But needless to say the store was beautiful. Selection of all things golf is any golfers dream but I'd rather spend my money at Sports Chalet at a cheaper price for my golf supplies any day.
cls	a	5	Really fresh, unique beers. Loved the pumpkin stout. Good food, had the pierogies, very buttery.  Excellent friendly service

cls	a	1	Really bad.  Changed ownership, new menu and this place sucks bad now.   My wife's pizza literally was soggy and tasted worse than a Celeste frozen pizza.   I got the Steak Frites ordered medium.  It was cold on the inside and pretty much raw.  So, I sent it back.  Seems like they need a lot of work to get back in shape.  Was so much better when it first opened.
skip	Cherise is awful!!!!!!! We signed up for her first year package. At first when signing up for one of Cherise's photo packages she is sweet and will communicate with you within a matter of minutes.  Once you pay and book with her then let the torture and anger begins. Her photos are okay, but save yourself the time and money and choose another photographer. It will take months for you to get your product and to have her respond to you after you have paid her a significant amount of money. Cherise is a terrible communicator and does not know how to run a business at all! It's funny... when she first posts your pictures online for review, you have 13 days or so to view them. If you do not make a selection at that time, she will then remove the photos and will charge you $50 dollar fee to post them back online. Cherise should pay my wife for all of my wife's efforts of trying to get our pictures that we paid good money for and a response back from this lady! Needless to say she will not be taking our son's year picture. Cherise is great at making facebook post. Maybe she should pay a little less attention to facebook and email her clients!
cls	a	3	GREEN CHILE CHICKEN BURRO! AIYIYIYIYIYIYIYI! [/battlecry]  Don't argue - it was featured in the Arizona Republic six years ago. This is the one place that I've remained a faithful customer to for the last 6 years. This is by far my longest love affair.  This probably isn't real Mexican food, but who cares. You like Panda Express, don't you? You can't go wrong with the tacos, tostadas, and buttered tortillas. Don't forget to stock up the salsa. It's amazing. I've seen people fight to the death for this stuff. Really.
skip	Sunshine cafe is a great place to have a home cooked meal while out and about. Great food great prices great service.
skip	Had the rosemary shrimp, grilled veggies, and the rosemary beef brisket. It was good but there are better places to stop in Pittsburgh. Sit outside and make sure you grab some spices if you want them. It's BYOB too.
cls	a	1	So obviously anyone who has moved to a different state obviously know how hard it can be to find all the right companies to help you with your job. We booked this place through movinghelpers.com (I think it was) and the number they gave us to call would NEVER work. We could not get through to these people for the life of us.  When we finally were able to schedule something, even the receptionist said others were having the same issues reaching them. I get a call about a week later saying they will not service us because they do NOT want a bad review (the online site has us review companies after they provided service). I guess figuring the communication issues they didn't want to risk their good score. But who knows how many others had the same thing happen. The girl was rude and aggressive on the phone when I was trying to explain we could not reach them, and didn't seem to want to hear what I had to say. Anyway, I wouldn't trust these people. I was anxious to leave a yelp review but disappointed they didn't have a Yelp yet. Either way, they still got their bad review.
skip	Urgency and customer service is not one of their strong points at this location in the afternoon.  Waiting in line while someone was figuring out what to order. One gal at the cash register and 3 baristas just talking while there was a line. It's kind of annoying when you see employees just standing around talking while customers are waiting. They could have opened the other cash register or started making the drinks for the others in line that knew what they wanted; just like they do in other Starbucks.  I will say I've been to this location a few times before and have had great service.  The gal working the register was very kind and said thanks for waiting.  If you're looking to get a quick drink in the afternoon, try a drive thru location.
cls	a	3	Not bad, not great.  We had two dishes... Pad Thai, which was not that good.  Also Orange Beef, which was good but salty.  Next time I will try the Chinese place at the Wynn.
cls	a	5	Genuine caring professionals committed to your success! An incredible transformative experience.
skip	We came for the &11.99 steak and lobster dinner and the steak was horrible (I know I know it's $11.99 for steak and lobster, can't expect much) but it was really BAD!!! Service was shitty and not worth the wait
skip	The one good thing this place has going for it is the beds - super comfy, made it hard to get up from a nap and go out!  Oh, and the rock memorabilia was very cool as well. The room could have been cleaner.  Everything was really dusty, including the items on the snack tray.  We arrived just after 8am on Saturday morning of Fourth of July weekend, and we were pleasantly surprised to get a room right away.  However, the staff wasn't particularly friendly.  Not rude, but just not friendly.  We had breakfast at Mr. Lucky's, then hit the pool.  We went to the Rehab pool first, where we would've had to purchase $100 in food and drinks each to use a lounge chair.  So we wandered to the \""family pool\"" where we could occupy lounge chairs without a food/drink minimum.  It was frustrating that they don't allow any outside food or drinks, not even water or gum!  So when we went to the bar to get a beer we would get a cup of ice too, and either let it melt down or fill it at the water fountain near the bathrooms.  Since we weren't staying Sunday night, we weren't given free admission to Rehab on Sunday, which was fine because we didn't really think that would be our scene anyway.   I'll miss their beds next time I'm in Vegas, but I probably won't stay here again.
cls	a	2	Went back for another friend's bday dinner. I didn't eat all my rice and they charged me $5.00 for it. How rude. I could of just hide the rice but I was too lazy and didn't want to brother with it. Left like 5-6 pieces of rice. Talk about crazy charge. Also they didn't have all the desserts. Grr..
cls	a	2	I hate giving this place such a poor review, but over all, I wasn't all that impressed.  I came here last night for dinner for the first time, and I can't say that I'm really interested in going back any time soon.  I was hungry, and wanted something different then the usual. I've driven by this place a zillion times, and figured I'd give it a try.  I went in and paid the $11.50 for a plate of food, and I really didn't like it all that much.  I built my own dish, but the meat looked really weird, and the bowls that you put it in were somewhat small.  The selection was meat, pork, chicken and fish. I went with the meat.  I topped it with a few veggies, some sauces, and the cook threw it on the grill. It came out fine, but the meat was just weird.  It was shaved, and was kinda tough.  Veggies and toppings were fresh, but limited.  More salad topping stuff then anything else.  Tomatos, cucumbers. carrots, celery....weird (but healthy) selection.  I was hoping for more variety there.  The staff here was friendly and helpful, I will give them that.  Place looks like it might have been an old fast food joint at one point?  I guess Im just not overall impressed, and had better experiences with Mongolian style cooking.  Sadly, this was not one of them.  :-(
cls	a	3	The pool is a pool. There are 2 pools. The common pool is shallow. There are read you can place your $8 beer and $4 water on.  The other pool is for private parties.If there is a pool party pay the extra $10-$20 to be in it. Even though they are next to eachother there is DEFINITLY a different vibe to it.
cls	a	2	I wish I would have read the reviews before booking my stay.   Renovations is an understatement. Wall paper coming off the walks, stains on carpeting walking to your room, it is worse than hotels on Fremont street.   When we got to the room, there was holes in the wall, wall paper peeling off, pink stains in bath tub broken glass in bath tub, it looked like a bad crime scene clean up.  The only reason I have three stars it's vascular u called the front desk and they moved our room, it was nicer and cleaner, but the condition of the hotel is yet to be desired, maybe after the renovations?
cls	a	1	I come here because it's the closest spot to my house. The staff is awful, but the men who work there are much easier to deal with than the women. ANY TIME I have dealt with a female, I've walked out without finishing what I came to do. They are so unhelpful and RUDE!   I walked in to pay a bill and only had $100.00 bill on me. Th lady who greeted me tried to send me to the kiosks and I told her, no I want to talk to a HUMAN. Then she said \""I don't have change, but you can go to chili's and get change\"" at that point she was lucky I didn't slap her. Basically she was tellin me NO ONE paid with cash that day? I call bullshit. Had she been nicer I wouldn't be yelping my horrible experience but she got all snarky the minute I didn't want to use to kiosks. I guess doing a job you get paid to is too hard to manage. I didn't get her name but I will be getting it!  You would think that since Verizon is the most expensive service, they would have better representatives, but they have like the worst customer service which is just not worth renewing my contract for.
skip	This place is just terrible on their BEST night! I've never really been a fan of the food but the drink prices are great and the service was always okay so we became  \""Members\""........This last year it has gone down hill FAST! Just left there from having dinner with my two Kids......Chicken fingers were burned and tasted like they were from yesterday...or the day before. They comped them. Which is their job so I won't get too excited about this. My sandwich was okay, nothing super memorable other than the BURNT chicken fingers. Took a Burger with bacon home to my Husband....the bacon was BLACK....so BURNT it was really quite unbelievable they would serve it to anyone. Burger, bun, and bacon and about 12 french fries for $12! No lettuce, mayo,  tomato, onion or a  pickle. My Husband said it was most deffinetley a frozen patty! They comped one kids meal due to the BURNT-ness of the chicken fingers! I have to say I have never really seen burnt deep fried food until tonight! So on that note I really have to give them some KUDOS. With one kids meal being comped and two Adult sandwiches and another Kids meal it was still $40! RIP OFF!!! I just can't imagine going back again. The last  4-5 times I have been there it has been a NIGHTMARE...with comps and long waits and forgotten items. I have decided not to give their food anymore chances so IF I do go back it will be to drink because as I mentioned above they have Great prices on their drinks.

cls	a	2	The pizza here is way undercooked. It seems to be a theme in Pittsburgh in general to not cook the pie long enough for it to crisp up and the cheese to get golden. The sauce was pretty generic and tasted like cheap stuff from a jar. The price was fair at about $2 a slice. The workers at the counter were friendly. However, the pizza itself is just doughy/rubbery and pretty bland.
cls	a	1	Cherise is awful!!!!!!! We signed up for her first year package.

cls	a	2	I live in the apartments across from here so I can't help but come here when I am craving wings, it's so convenient!  But I'm not going to sugar coat it...the service is horrible. On more than one occasion I see servers standing around talking or huddling in a corner, not checking on customers, or looking like they would rather not be there (and I'm sure they don't) but that attitude reads all over your face and body language and really turns customers off...killing the entire experience.  Now when I crave wings I just order to-go and skip the drama.
cls	a	2	Came in for the first time in a long time. Kind of disappionted, condiments fell out of both halves of the footlong my son and i split and the gal behind the conter started giggling when she was corrected on the sandwhich after putting chicken on it. I think it will be a while before i return to this location again.
skip	Ok, I just stayed here and wanted to point out some points that you may find helpful before booking your stay.  1.  Service at this resort is excruciatingly slow.  (Asked for a bell hop and after 25 minutes of no one showing up made the multiple trips down to the car to load all the bags)  2.  Drinks are expensive by the pool.  (Try a pina colada for $12.  They are strong and granted we are in snottsdale but that still seems a bit overboard for a coconut drink)  3.  The rooms are excellent, large and well appointed.  (although you have to pay for most of the fancy appointments)  The bathrooms are large and very nice.  The bed has to be one of the best I've slept in in a long time.  4.  The lazy river is great for relaxing except for the fact that there are kids running and splashing everywhere with what appears to be absolutely no supervision.  Not even a staff will stop and tell them to stop running even though it is just an injury and law suit away.  The only adult only pool is atop the spa and you have to pay $35 per day extra just to get in to it.  5.  The Meritage steakhouse at the golf course is far below average.  Service was slow and with noticeable disdain from the staff there.  The food is average at best.  Potatoes are pasty, green beans were stringy and the meat was just so so on being cooked right.  I would suggest eating off property if you are looking for a good steak dinner.  I'm not trying to bag on this hotel to be mean but when you claim your a high end resort with lots amenities then the service, food and atmosphere must live up to those expectations and unfortunately this hotel/resort does not do it.
skip	Top shelf cleaning and service! They cleaned my 2014 RAM 1500 Laramie after two months of hunting season travels through snow, ice, salt and off road hunting.  Amazing it looks like a new truck again.  Great job and highly recommended for luxury cars and any car that matters to you!
cls	a	4	Same owners as P.F. Chang's.  Keep in mind this is FAST FOOD, and judging it by what other fast food is like out there, Pei Wei hits a home run.  For modest prices, you get an order that easily feeds two people.  So, for less than $10, two people can eat a freshly prepared meal that is fairly healthy.  Very busy at prime dining hours.  Suggest early, late, or takeout order.  Blazing noodles is excellent.
skip	Definitely my new favorite go to restaurant in Vegas.  Found this place today and had an awesome meal which was real authentic Mexican.
skip	Excellent for the middle of the corn fields. I wish this was around back in the day. Their sauces are rich and flavorful.

cls	a	2	I must have blinked, and missed something, as I am not sure what happened to this restaurant. I remember coming here with friends in the 90s and it had big portions, reasonable prices and friendly service.   When you walk into this restaurant, it is amazing. The decor screams, we went through a restaurant makeover, look at us! look at us! And as a person who doesn't like change, I was leary but remembered that they had some good food here. It was busy but we were still seated quickly.   Looking over the menu, I noticed that it had definitely changed. Or did it? It still served pizza and subs, but MORE. The prices have definitely gone up, A LOT. I remember that my usual order of their combo contained had BOTH pizza and a sub, which were no longer on the menu together.   BTW, $3 for a soft drink and no refill.   The food is exactly like your neighbourhood pizza joint, very tasty.  The prices are more than I would have liked to spend.  The ambiance, WOW!!!!  So, food was still good, value no longer there.
cls	a	1	Another disappointing place in Anthem.  We tried this for the first time on October 30th for my birthday.  When we walked in, no one was behind the bar and we had to wait about 5 minutes before the hostess/bartender/waitress came by to say she would be with us in a few minutes.  After a few minutes, she came and took our order.  My husband and I both ordered wine and thought we would try a couple of appetizers.  We ordered the bruschetta and the cheese plate and to be honest, I could have done a better job at home.  Will not be returning even though the wine was decent (hard to screw that up) and service was good after the first initial problem we had.
skip	I used to work on that side of town, and would eat there fairly regularly. It's like any buffet, if you get there when they're busy, there's usually a pretty good selection of fresh pasta and pizza. Go when it's not lunch or dinner, and you'll find less selection, and not as fresh, but overall, a pretty good choice for the money. I would recommend at least checking it out if you're on that side of town and craving italian/pizza buffet.
skip	I stayed here 6/29/2012 to 07/01/2012.  Got a good price to stay here, so we booked the standard luxury room. Arrived pretty late--about 1:00 am Saturday morning--and got a complimentary upgrade to a LeMans suite since they were out of standard luxury rooms. Sweet!!  The suite itself looked great; decor and furniture were of high quality. Full size shower and hot tub in the bathroom. And a bidet!! The weirdest thing though was the old school box TV set. Umm, okay. Otherwise great room.  The clientele at Paris, however, is OLD (no offense). Nice place to stay at with your significant other; not so nice a place if you're out with your buddies or for a bachelor party.
cls	a	5	Those who know Primo know that I'm the risk-taking, living-on-the-edge gambler type, the sort your mom warned you against, the sort that has no problem letting strange barbers take their razor and scissors to my head with nothing but a Yelp recommendation for safety and comfort.   That's why, when I found myself in dire need of a haircut while on business in Scottsdale-Phoenix, I ended up in the very competent, very talented, and very hilarious hands of the father and son duo that run this follicle trimmery a couple of blocks from the W Hotel where I was staying.   The shop has the clubby feel of a man cave, with plush leather chairs, baseball memorabilia on the walls, and tvs tuned to The Fugitive (love that movie!). The experience was replete with mild racist, ageist and misogynist humor, the sort that sets apart an established shop from the crappy corporate owned chains whose sole intention is to upsell unnecessary products. At Shaving Grace, on the other hand, the only thing being sold aside from an excellent haircut is an old-world, graceful experience, and Primo now has a new go-to barber in Phoenix.   Highly recommended.

skip	I thought this was pretty good - a nice selection of different types of food - fresh fruit/vegetables as well as a variety of prepared foods: sausage, cheese, pastries, etc.  You can definitely make a meal from here as well as take fresh items to cook back home.

skip	Love this place !!! Best specials all week long!!! Great food and a fun place to hangout !!!
cls	a	4	Really surprised by this place. Very nice! Rooms are decorated nicely, beds are comfy, and spacious. Stayed in a Studio and there was plenty of room! Nice bathroom, nice pool. My one complaint would be the thin walls. We could hear our  neighbors talking all night then when we were still talking at 1am, neighbors pounded the wall to tell us to be quiet lol. The night before the 4th of July in Vegas and you're pounding on the wall to shoosh us? Lame!   Food and drinks at the pool are expensive, and quite a few kids splashing around. I guess I prefer adult only in Vegas but what can you do? Food was good. Room Service menu is outrageously priced. The nice thing is, Elara is connected to the Miracle Mile Shops @ Planet Hollywood, quick walk (indoors, thank God, it's summer!) and there are 15 places to eat in the mall, plus several options on the strip, which is priced roughly the same if not less than room service prices.   I would definitely stay here again. Park at the garage at Miracle Mile Shops. Leads right into Elara, otherwise Valet is $15 a night, your choice!  Views aren't too bad either! Not much else to say, been a fun night/day, one night to go!
skip	Did same day dry cleaning and clothes came out looking ironed but not cleaned. Buttons were missing or loose. Terrible customer service.  I will never return. I absolutely do not recommend this place.
skip	3.5 stars for Naka Sushi  Pros 1. Not busy during lunch 2. Sushi chef EXTREMELY quick. 3. Rolls are pretty good. 4. Customer service was good with some singing and grunting from the chef.   Cons 1. Nigiri quality wasn't up to par. Definitely not as fresh as other places and the salmon was very slimey and gooey. Yuck! 2. Not a huge selection of nigiri. 3. I would say 90% off the rolls contained spicy tuna...which I'm unable to eat right now so boo!   Overall it's a decent sushi joint but I won't be making any special trips to this side of town to eat here.
cls	a	4	The Cheesesteak is the best in Vegas.  Outdoor seating only.  Go when the weather is nice.
cls	a	3	we came as a large group and were seated upstairs for the all you can eat menu. the price is right and the menu is awesome given that there are so many choices and the appetizers are actually really good. however our orders were constantly being mixed up and we were being served sushi that our table didnt order. it's a shame they closed because i was hoping to come back the next time i am in montreal.
skip	This is one of my favorite places to buy gifts!  Who doesn't love fabulous chocolate?  The chocolates here are amazing, interesting (unexpected) tastes- if that makes sense.  One time I had a chilli orange dark chocolate with puffed rice, it was the most amazing piece of chocolate I have ever tasted.  I bought a little box of them and have not seen it since last July.  Godiva is nice but Max Brenner is definitely on a different level.      Their food is good here and the atmosphere is nice considering it's in the mall.  I've had all wonderful experiences here the numerous times I've come for lunch while shopping, and to buy gifts except one time.  About two weeks ago I was here and trying to find someone to help me with chocolate selection.  The two women who were working there, told me with a hand gesture to wait \""one second,\"" and continued their conversation behind the counter.  I stood there politely and listened to their unimportant conversation.. 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and then I saw that I was there standing for 10 minutes just watching them talk while they ignored me and I walked out totally pissed off.  I've been thinking about phoning in to complain about the women, but it's more my style to YELP the complaint in the hopes that someone in management will hear.    On a more positive note, this is the only bad experience I've had here, there are so many times where I've had lunch here and the service (which is always secondary in importance to me next to the food) is perfect.   Try their espresso/chocolate drinks they are phenomenal.
skip	The WORST dining experience of my life. My salad was like a left over from the '70's. Some wilted lettuce, mushy chunk of avocado, a couple of apple chucks and topped with mushy tomato slices. Bottled salad dressing. Hubby's ravioli had a white sauce that reminded me of a home economics class in high school. Moving along, the acoustics in the space are horrific, so there is a cacophony of noise assaulting you throughout the meal. Top it off with a table of the most ignorant young couples who thought that their children's scccreammmming was the cutest thing since hand to hand combat. A good restaurant knows how to politely and diplomatically tell unruly customers that they are disturbing the other diners. Just because they stick 'organic' in their name does not give a restaurant the right to cook very badly!!! When I told the waitress this was our first visit, she said nothing in the way of introducing the restaurant to us.
cls	a	5	The short ribs are wonderful. I've had them twice. So tender you don't need a fork and the demi is a great compliment to the rich meat. I am picky about my short ribs and I will order them on my 3rd visit! My husband has had the cast iron skillet strip and loved it. Perfectly cooked and the wilted spinach was a good match. For $23, this is a great deal. You will be hard pressed to find a steak this good for that price!
skip	we came as a large group and were seated upstairs for the all you can eat menu. the price is right and the menu is awesome given that there are so many choices and the appetizers are actually really good. however our orders were constantly being mixed up and we were being served sushi that our table didnt order. it's a shame they closed because i was hoping to come back the next time i am in montreal.
skip	First of all, I like the location of this hotel.  And if you're going to park, by all means do Valet and pay the few bucks tip, because self-parking is a mile away.  We got a strip suite and a regular suite, both facing the Fountain.  Nice view, but though the Strip Suite is supposed to be larger, which it was, it just felt smaller due to the floorplan.  It was rather rectangular and narrow, thus feeling more cramped to be in. The random Hollywood movie decorations are sort of tacky; we had a plastic gun and sweater in our room from Star Trek that wasn't very attractive but I had a pleasant stay.  All in all, the location of this hotel is good, though it's right across the street from the current new apt construction.  Puts you in good location from the North and South ends of the strip.  And there's the Miracle Miles mall right next door.
skip	Included it as a stop on a trip to Vegas, March 2013. Sadden that when we arrived, the business was closed.
cls	a	4	Excellent for the middle of the corn fields. I wish this was around back in the day. Their sauces are rich and flavorful.
skip	Another disappointing place in Anthem.  We tried this for the first time on October 30th for my birthday.  When we walked in, no one was behind the bar and we had to wait about 5 minutes before the hostess/bartender/waitress came by to say she would be with us in a few minutes.  After a few minutes, she came and took our order.  My husband and I both ordered wine and thought we would try a couple of appetizers.  We ordered the bruschetta and the cheese plate and to be honest, I could have done a better job at home.  Will not be returning even though the wine was decent (hard to screw that up) and service was good after the first initial problem we had.
cls	a	2	a buddy of mine couldn't say enough great things about this place, so we met him and his girlfriend here last night for our first try.   it was very quiet and quite empty, but that didn't turn us off. i started with the calderita margarita, a very large and tasty drink with a peppery kick. we had the fish taco appetizer and i thought it was very good. the mango salsa added a nice spicy/sweet flavor.   my entree was a seafood \""soup\"" in a white sauce. honestly though, as i was eating it, it didn't have any mexican flavor...it was more of an italian style dish. plus, several of my clams weren't steamed open, which means somethings wrong. the very least, they should've removed them from the dish. i've read if you eat unopened clams, you can get extremely ill. my wife had the shrimp diablo. yes, they were very hot, but at 24 bucks, i thought she'd get more than 4-5 shrimp.   the chips and salsa were fine. we had to keep asking for more chips and never got the salsa's refilled...big disappointment. they did not pass the water glass test. our server was sweet, but hard to find. what disappointed me the most was what our dining companions had to say. his g-friend had the calderita as well and had to send it back. minutes later, my buddy had to have his calderita sent back. he was disappointed in his normally outstanding pasta dish. they both apologized for suggesting Caldero and said our experience this night wasn't indicative of their previous dining experiences there.   and they advertise as a tequila bar, but we never saw a menu for tequilas...maybe if you sit at the bar. overall, i thought our dishes were overpriced and lacked Mexican inspired flavors. our friends will be back as they had previously good experiences, but we have other places we want to try so i doubt we'll be back.
skip	Same owners as P.F. Chang's.  Keep in mind this is FAST FOOD, and judging it by what other fast food is like out there, Pei Wei hits a home run.  For modest prices, you get an order that easily feeds two people.  So, for less than $10, two people can eat a freshly prepared meal that is fairly healthy.  Very busy at prime dining hours.  Suggest early, late, or takeout order.  Blazing noodles is excellent.
skip	My wife has recently started learning to change her oil and make repairs on her car. I ofter get dragged along to go get parts. They all know her there by now. Everyone is always friendly and ready to answer her questions and give her advice.
skip	One thing I must say is the entrees are absolutely delish but the anti mass transit owner is a bit eccentric to say the least... I've indulged here two different pleasant occasions, you have to have time on your side if you wish to dine here because there is a strict NO TO GO policy that owner adheres strictly... I had a very tart and bitter banana strawberry smoothie... I would go back but I do not believe it'll stay open for the long haul.
skip	The pizza here is way undercooked. It seems to be a theme in Pittsburgh in general to not cook the pie long enough for it to crisp up and the cheese to get golden. The sauce was pretty generic and tasted like cheap stuff from a jar. The price was fair at about $2 a slice. The workers at the counter were friendly. However, the pizza itself is just doughy/rubbery and pretty bland.
skip	I brought my date to this restaurant because of her previous experience with their green curry. We ordered the green curry and the chicken basil with a sticky on the side. Although the green curry and chicken basil was delicious, the sticky was rock solid. As far I can remember, sticky rice were not suppose to be like rocks.  Furthermore, we ordered the mango sticky rice dessert. That too was a big disappointment. It was sad when my date stated that she can make better product that Yupha.  Lastly, the service was sub-par when it gets busy. We tried numerous times flagging a helper for addition rice. I think the service is good when it isn't busy.   Although this restaurant is close to my house, I don't think I will visit this place much...unless I crave some green curry....
cls	a	2	Took my girlfriend here for our anniversary, because of many glowing recommendations from friends. After being seated promptly, we waited about 10 minutes to be acknowledged by a server, and given water and menus. After this, the server was attentive enough.   We started with the cheese tray, which was good and all, but was only 3 little slices of cheese. For $12 I expected a bit more quantity.  She had the NY strip au poivre (her favorite), and I had the flatiron steak. Hers was undercooked, and the brandy/cream sauce tasted more like turkey gravy than anything else. She's had this dish in Paris, and I've made it several times at home, and George's sauce wasn't even close. My flatiron steak was pretty good, but a little undercooked. The frites were nice and crunchy, but way too much salt.   For the price, there are MUCH better restaurants in Charlotte. We won't be back to this one.
cls	a	4	Great relaxing 2 night getaway with my wife.  Service was excellent, room was very comfortable....a very peaceful place.  R Bar was a great place to hang out and listen to music and enjoy some drinks.  Breakfast and service at Rita's on the patio was very good (despite a few pesky birds).  Poolside service was excellent...watermelon/mint iced water; watermelon cubes served from time to time...all excellent.  \""Where time stands still\""...I'll be sure to go back. The gardens are beautiful...we live in the valley and it's nice to visit a place like this and really take in desert living in a very relaxing setting.
skip	The pawn shop itself has a wide selection of jewelry, appliances, watches, etc.  However the staff that I encountered both times I was there were very rude. They acted very pretentious and were not the best negotiators.
skip	The pool is a pool. There are 2 pools. The common pool is shallow. There are read you can place your $8 beer and $4 water on.  The other pool is for private parties.If there is a pool party pay the extra $10-$20 to be in it. Even though they are next to eachother there is DEFINITLY a different vibe to it.
skip	I can not review the service or the rooms because I did not stay here.  I did come here for a seminar and from what I saw the place was very nice. The front desk area was clean and decorated wonderfully.  They have a gift shop along with a dinning area.  We did have a comped lunch at the restaurant and the food was mediocre. I was not impressed, in fact all I could eat was the salad.  The seminar area was a normal room, nothing fancy.  The bathrooms were clean and smelled decent.  I asked someone who was staying in the rooms and they told me they were nice. They had a kitchen and were very large.
skip	Genuine caring professionals committed to your success! An incredible transformative experience.
skip	Lee's on Las Vegas Blvd is on of the best places for someone staying on the South end of the strip to buy their bulk liquer in my humble opinion.  It's located across from Stoney's and makes a short journey for those staying at the Sout Point.   Remember to bring cash or debit in order to get the advertised discounts.
skip	Went back for another friend's bday dinner. I didn't eat all my rice and they charged me $5.00 for it. How rude. I could of just hide the rice but I was too lazy and didn't want to brother with it. Left like 5-6 pieces of rice. Talk about crazy charge. Also they didn't have all the desserts. Grr..
skip	What can you say, you can't beat the $10 month to month membership.  It does not have everything you would find in a full service gym but for the cost it is an excellent value.  There are three things I wish they had but won't complain; steam room, sauna and a rower machine.  Like all gyms you will find free weights, weight machines, tons of cardio machines with TV's and iPod connectors.  You will always find a cardio machine during peak times but will not find any classes or daycare but again for the price no biggie.
cls	a	2	I've had Rosati's from several locations in Phoenix. At my house I have two stores within range and when I am at my friends we order Rosati's near them. Ordered a Pan style. The ingredients are very good (as they are at every Rosati's I've ordered from) and it actually arrived without the top of the pizza sliding all to one side... Kudos the the delivery guy.  However, I counted six (6) tomato tops in the sauce on the pieces I grabbed. In my opinion it completely ruined my experience. The tops I am referring to are where the stem connects to the tomato. That little piece of stem ruined it for me. One maybe....six????
cls	a	3	More like 2.5 stars.   This place is kind of a clusterfuck.  The evening classes are always PACKED, so you have to go early to sign up outside which is more difficult and confusing than it should be.   Most of the classes are taught by the owner - and I don't think she is a very good yoga instructor.  She is more of an aerobics/fitness instructor - she wants you to feel the burn, push yourself to your limits and plays loud pop music during class.  The instructor who does the Tuesday/Thursday evening classes is much better and yoga-ish, its more relaxing while still getting in a good sweaty session.  I always feel so good when it is over!   Something about this place that really skeeves me out: Towards the end of class, before relaxation, the instructor (and 2 volunteers) come around and give EVERY person a little back and foot massage.  That would feel nice if this were a normal yoga class, but considering how much everyone is sweating, its kinda gross.  I don't know if that is normal for hot yoga classes, but its unsanitary...   Sometimes the owner locks her dog up inside her car while she is in class, which I think is mean.  I hope she doesn't do that in the summer time.
cls	a	3	Some dishes are good, some taste like they came out of a can from the Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center.  The heaven rice rolls might be my favorite in town, and the lobster dish is fantastic (definitely agree with kate - doesn't taste like lobster, but is delicious nonetheless).  Free tea is always a really nice way to start a meal, too.
cls	a	5	This place was great!  Yes, it is off the strip, however casino parking is free and this was a family trip so there was not heavy drinking so driving was not a problem. It took us less than 5 minutes to get to the strip. There is a shuttle but we did not use it so I am unsure of how it works.  This resort is converted from apartments so the units are huge. We stayed in a two-bedroom suite and there was living room, balcony (overlooking the pool), two bathrooms, a dining area and a full kitchen.  There were walk in closets in both bedrooms. There was also a washing machine and dryer in the suite, which was really convenient.   The couch was pretty comfortable. I thought the bed was really comfortable. I wish I would have brought my pillow, however their pillows were not to bad.  The pool and hot tub were fun and so close to our unit. The waterfall was never on, however we stayed in December so perhaps it is only a summer thing. We had so much fun in the heated swimming pool, the waterfall was not missed at all.  The staff was amazing.  When the check-in person saw we had kids, he offered to switch our room to one overlooking the pool, we didn't event have to ask.  The concierge is super friendly and helpful.  We went to Trader Joe's and purchased some groceries.  The kitchen comes with everything you need to cook a basic meal and then some! We did mostly lunch buffet to save money and had breakfast and dinner in the suite.  We had a great time and I can't wait to stay here again.

skip	Nice clean restaurant with plenty of parking in a strip mall.  Menu has nice variety of Vietnamese cuisine.  Pho Dac Biet is good. Plenty of noodles and meat to fill you up.  Spring rolls were delicious as well.  Good came out really fast when they not busy.

cls	a	3	It's a nice place, don't get me wrong. They have a good selection, with a wide supply of different candles, fragrances, oils, cards, etc. It's not a bad place to buy a little gift for someone.  They do have (what I thought was) a kind of cool thing where you can choose fragrances to mix into a custom lotion/perfume/etc. I had a lotion mixed for my roommate, and even though there were three different scents in there, it barely smelled like anything. So that was pretty disappointing. Can't say anything about the custom perfume or other custom products.  Overall, it was OK, but I wasn't \""wow'd\"" or anything.
skip	I hate to be like this, but this new place just isn't as good as the old.  Their pizza used to be much better; especially the crust.  I can't put my finger on it but something is just different and not in a good way.  The prices have always been on the high side for pizza but it was always worth it.  Not anymore.  I am almost never in Tempe so when I knew I would be for the day, I wanted to have this pizza.  I didn't even know they moved until I saw it here on Yelp.  I knew the shopping center where the place is now located so I knew just where to go.  However, it ticked me off that it was a pain in the ass to find because there was nothing that said \""Classic Italian Pizza\"" anywhere on their exterior sign OR anywhere in the actual restaurant.  Upon finding then entering the place I almost had to ask if I was in right place.  Anyway, the service was excellent but I don't think I'll be back because the pizza wasn't go-out-of-your-way good enough.
cls	a	5	Top shelf cleaning and service! They cleaned my 2014 RAM 1500 Laramie after two months of hunting season travels through snow, ice, salt and off road hunting.  Amazing it looks like a new truck again.  Great job and highly recommended for luxury cars and any car that matters to you!
skip	The short ribs are wonderful. I've had them twice. So tender you don't need a fork and the demi is a great compliment to the rich meat.

For $23, this is a great deal. You will be hard pressed to find a steak this good for that price!
cls	a	1	I believe, the only reason why this place receives business is because people rather not wait for food at the ramen place across the plaza. Not great. The Thai tea is cheap but comes in a small styrofoam cup and filled half with ice. Also, if your group orders the Thai tea, some will have a good amount of milk and some will not. I chose the house seafood special with rice noodles. The soup was not spicy at all and the soup base made me feel sick. Everything is cheap, but that's all the quality food you get.

cls	a	5	I recommend using Jason for any trip or event in Vegas.The customer service he provides, is nothing but perfect. I went out for my buddies birthday celebration and the whole weekend was full of excitement and amazing memories. I will never go to Vegas and not use Jason!! Thank you Jason for the best time ever in vegas!!
cls	a	3	FINALLY got a call from the manager of the office after emailing twice. I received 3 months of free contacts, which is great since my lenses are really expensive. The manager was really nice and wouldn't stop apologizing for the awful experience. However, when I went in to pick up the contacts, all of the girls at the desk were rude. There was no \""How are you\"" or any of that. I even witnessed one of them say \""just sit down over there and I'll get to you in a minute\"". Only reason for the 3 is because the manager was so nice once I got her on the phone.
cls	a	2	The pawn shop itself has a wide selection of jewelry, appliances, watches, etc.  However the staff that I encountered both times I was there were very rude. They acted very pretentious and were not the best negotiators.
cls	a	4	Pretty good! Had the basic udon. Reasonably priced, tasty food and the resturant is pretty cool. 4 stars because it didn't blow my socks off
cls	a	3	Another Thai restaurant experience - lunch specials are the way to go I tell you!  First off, Panna Thai Restaurant looks a bit more upscale than your average Thai joint, which I think reflects in the price as well.  We walked in to a relatively empty restaurant on a weekday.  As the waiter brought us to our table, he immediately asked if we had any coupons (before we even sat down).  We did not, but apparently they do have a lot floating around and are a bit restrictive about how they are used.  I think they are also on restaurant.com too.  Lunch specials are available everyday from 11 am to 4 pm.  They all include a fried wonton, fresh salad, steamed rice, and soup of the day.  (You can substitute fried rice or brown rice for $1 more.)    Started off with miso soup.  Interesting choice.   I went for the Yellow Curry Lunch Special with Tofu \""Thai yellow curry and Thai herbs served with Jasmine rice.\"" ($6.95).   Fried tofu and potatoes were the main components of my dish.  Raw bell peppers decorated the top.  I wished they cooked the veggies with the curry though.  The fried wonton had peas and carrots in it - a bit different than what you normally find inside one of those things.  The biggest problem I had was with the rice.  It was mushy - too much water in the cooker!  It's never a good sign when the rice gets messed up!   The Husband tried out their Garlic Short Ribs Lunch Special \""Deep fried short ribs sauteed with garlic and black pepper sauce served with Jasmine rice.\"" ($6.95)  It was a tasty dish and lots of flavor, but then again it's deep fried and it sounds like it would be tasty.  Overall, we found Panna Thai to be just an okay experience.  There are definitely a few other Thai restaurants in the neighborhood that has a foot up on selection, taste, and price.
cls	a	1	Did same day dry cleaning and clothes came out looking ironed but not cleaned. Buttons were missing or loose. Terrible customer service.  I will never return. I absolutely do not recommend this place.
cls	a	5	One of the best In-N-Out Burgers I've been to (let's not talk about the one near Embarcadero in San Francisco--meh). You know how burgers look in ads? Well ours looked camera ready and tasted even better than they looked. Extremely happy and helpful staff (almost thought we were in Stepford). Insanely fast drive thru service.

cls	a	5	Definitely my new favorite go to restaurant in Vegas.  Found this place today and had an awesome meal which was real authentic Mexican.
skip	We always stay in summer in this hotel, totally recommended, my kids love the beach, lazy river and all the different pools available, great for families!!
skip	I live in the apartments across from here so I can't help but come here when I am craving wings, it's so convenient!  But I'm not going to sugar coat it...the service is horrible. On more than one occasion I see servers standing around talking or huddling in a corner, not checking on customers, or looking like they would rather not be there (and I'm sure they don't) but that attitude reads all over your face and body language and really turns customers off...killing the entire experience.  Now when I crave wings I just order to-go and skip the drama.
skip	I feel like reviews for large chains like Starbucks can help people differentiate between the good and the bad.  I have noticed that this place in particular is pretty inconsistent with the drinks and service. There have been multiple times where I've received the wrong drink. 99% of the time I am going through the drive through, so by the time I realize the mistake, I am so far gone that I can't go back to correct it.  On the upside, the people here are friendly. I do not recall every encountering a grumpy or rude person here.
skip	Celebrated my gf's 25th Bday in Vegas. Needed a cake to go along with all my other surprises. Came up on LAS VEGAS CUSTOM CAKES and was amazed with the cakes on their website. Great price with great work and not crazy expensive price with great work. I ordered a Coach purse cake with custom receipt of all the things we did on top of a Coach gift box and (8) Hello Kitty Cheesecake cupcakes.   The true test would be how this cake/cucakes tested ( have had dry Red Velvet and really sweet Red Velvet - couldn't do a taste test since I am from out of town). The design of the cake/cupcakes were amazing and the cake/cupcakes  tasted great as well! Hands down best Red Velvet cake I have ever tasted.  Did not disappoint!! My GF and I did not want to eat it but rather take it home and put it on a mantel since these are masterpieces!   If you are ever in Vegas, check them out. You won't be disappointed.
skip	I hate giving this place such a poor review, but over all, I wasn't all that impressed.  I came here last night for dinner for the first time, and I can't say that I'm really interested in going back any time soon.  I was hungry, and wanted something different then the usual. I've driven by this place a zillion times, and figured I'd give it a try.  I went in and paid the $11.50 for a plate of food, and I really didn't like it all that much.  I built my own dish, but the meat looked really weird, and the bowls that you put it in were somewhat small.  The selection was meat, pork, chicken and fish. I went with the meat.  I topped it with a few veggies, some sauces, and the cook threw it on the grill. It came out fine, but the meat was just weird.  It was shaved, and was kinda tough.  Veggies and toppings were fresh, but limited.  More salad topping stuff then anything else.  Tomatos, cucumbers. carrots, celery....weird (but healthy) selection.  I was hoping for more variety there.  The staff here was friendly and helpful, I will give them that.  Place looks like it might have been an old fast food joint at one point?  I guess Im just not overall impressed, and had better experiences with Mongolian style cooking.  Sadly, this was not one of them.  :-(
cls	a	4	Just northwest of 32nd and Camelback, wrapping around the Biltmore Golf Course, is a 2 mile paved residential street known to locals as \""the Biltmore Loop\"" (Biltmore Estate Drive).  It is flat loop with light traffic.  It is perfect for doing intervals if you are training for a long distance running event, or just an evening stroll if that is more your speed.  It's fun to check out the multi-million dollar digs and it is relatively scenic with the golf course and the mountains as a backdrop.  I mean, there is a reason why there is a 20 million dollar house for sale on this loop (I'm not kidding, I saw the sign with my own eyes).  I always feel safe running here.  There is usually at least a few people running or walking the loop.  I suggest parking by Hava Java and running up to Colter to cut over onto the loop.
cls	a	4	It's Target. Definitely nicer than Wally World but pretty much your standard Target.
